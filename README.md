# DS-Class
## Practice GitHub Markdown (GFM)
### This is a README.md file
###### This is smallest font

See the following useful **_GitHub Flavor Markdown_** syntax:
- This is **inline code** like pip command: `sort file.txt| uniq | wc -l` which asked alot during the interview
- This is *inline code block* 
    ```ls -a
       grep -ni 'pandas*' *.*
       find . -name 'seattle' -print
    ```
- This is *** python function code block ***
    ``` def function(x):
          return x**2    
    ```
- ~~WDI class not for me~~ __WDS is good__ for me!

**To do _list_**
* study DS 04
* do homework
* movie time

__*Show me how the sorted list works:*__
